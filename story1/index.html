			A flock of seagulls crashed into the nose of a Jetblue airplane on March 28, forcing the plane to make an emergency landing at John F. Kennedy Airport, just 25 minutes after its takeoff. News of this strike sparked memories among New Yorkers of the infamous “Miracle on the Hudson”, the story of US Airways Flight 1549 that landed in the New York river in January 2009. Shortly after takeoff, a flock of Canadian geese flew into the engines of the Airbus 320, fatally disabling the plane’s ability to fly, however saved by ingenuity of the pilots as it crash landed in the river.

			What leads to events like these may seem a rare occurrence, but they happen far more often than we think. When you’re sitting on the plane waiting for take-off, bird strikes may not be your first concern, but airports across the U.S. are investing millions each year into “wildlife management programs” to prevent another miracle on the Hudson.
		</p>
		<p>
			In New York City’s metropolitan area, bird strikes occur nearly once a day (0.9 times) on average. Across the nation’s 19,000 airports, avian strikes happen nearly 30 times a day on average. With New York’s three primary airports located near large wildlife reserves and wetlands, planes are at a high risk of migratory birds, such as those that struck US Airways Flight 1549.

			Although the number of bird strikes is small compared with the daily number of flights in the New York City region, the hidden costs of strikes are underestimated. According to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), wildlife strikes delay planes for about 600,000 hours annually. Additionally, the cost of delays and plane damage amounts to nearly $1 billion per year, though less than 10 percent of planes sustain damage.
		</p>
		<p>
			Michael Begier, national coordinator of the airport wildlife hazards program at the U.S. Department of Agriculture, said that although the number of damage-causing bird strikes has decreased during the past two decades, the number of reported bird strikes has gone up. According to FAA data, the number of strikes reported annually in New York City increased 337% between 1990 and 2013 (this figure takes into account the growth in air traffic between these years).
		</p>
		<p>
			According to the FAA, bird strikes are increasing for three key reasons. The populations of many large bird species have burgeoned as a result of adaptation to urban areas as well as airports. Alongside the expanding bird population, plane flights have increased in frequency as well from 310 million flights in 1980 to 725 million in 2012.

			Curiously, advancements in plane technology have also contributed to high bird strike rates. More recently constructed planes have two engines, instead of three or four like in the past.  This means that, “in the event of a multiple ingestion event, aircraft with two engines may have vulnerabilities not shared by their three or four engine-equipped counterparts,” claims a recent FAA report. Furthermore,“research has indicated that birds are less able to detect and avoid modern jet aircraft with quieter turbofan engines than older aircraft with noisier engines.”
		</p>
		<p>
			Given the frequency of bird strikes, the FAA and USDA are taking measures to ensure the safety of passengers. The FAA has invested in avian radar systems to detect and track birds around airports. Additionally, the USDA employs “wildlife biologists” to find more efficient ways to manage airport environments, even if that means killing birds and small mammals. Despite these precautions, bird strikes remain a threat.
