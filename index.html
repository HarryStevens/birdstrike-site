							Shortly after taking off from Westchester County Airport this March, a JetBlue airplane was forced to make an emergency landing after it barrelled into a flock of seagulls. The plane landed safely at John F. Kennedy International, and its passengers, though rattled, were able to catch a later flight to Miami.
						<p>
							<a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/e-plane-emergency-landing-jfk-article-1.1737787">News of the emergency landing</a> sparked memories of 2009's “Miracle on the Hudson," when a U.S. Airways pilot was forced to <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/todayinthesky/2014/01/15/five-years-ago-today-miracle-on-the-hudson-landing/4489875/">crash land his plane into the New York river</a> after a flock of Canadian geese flew into the plane's engines, fatally disabling the plane’s ability to fly.
						</p>
						<p>
							Media coverage may make such bird strikes seem rare, but similar occurrences are common. When you’re sitting on the plane waiting for take-off, bird strikes may not be your first concern, but airports across the U.S. are investing millions each year into “wildlife management programs” to prevent another miracle on the Hudson.
						</p>
						<p>
							The Federal Aviation Administration and U.S. Department of Agriculture are taking measures to ensure the safety of passengers. The FAA has invested in <a href="http://www.faa.gov/airports/resources/advisory_circulars/index.cfm/go/document.information/documentNumber/150_5220-25">avian radar systems</a> to detect and track birds around airports. Additionally, the USDA employs “wildlife biologists” to find more efficient ways to manage airport environments, even if that means killing birds and small mammals. Despite these precautions, the frequency of bird strikes has risen in recent years.
						</p>
						<p>
							At the six airports owned by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey &ndash; John F. Kennedy, LaGuardia, Newark Liberty, Teterboro, Atlantic City and Stewart &ndash; bird strikes have increased since 1990. Even taking into account the increase in the number of flights, the birdstrike rate has jumped notably.
							<div class="chart-title">
								Birdstrikes per 100,000 Air Movements* at All Port Authority Airports, 1990-2013
							</div>
							<div id="ChartDiv2" class="viz"></div>
						<p class="chart-note">
							*Air movements include both takeoffs and landings.
						</p>
						<p>
							Michael Begier, national coordinator of the airport wildlife hazards program at the USDA, said that although the number of damage-causing bird strikes has decreased during the past two decades, the number of reported bird strikes has gone up. According to FAA data, the number of strikes reported annually in New York City increased 337% between 1990 and 2013 (this figure takes into account the growth in air traffic between these years).
						</p>
						<p>
							According to the FAA, bird strikes are increasing for three key reasons. The populations of many large bird species have burgeoned as a result of adaptation to urban areas as well as airports. Alongside the expanding bird population, plane flights have increased in frequency as well from 310 million flights in 1980 to 725 million in 2012.
						</p>
						<p>
							Curiously, advancements in plane technology have also contributed to high bird strike rates. More recently constructed planes have two engines, instead of three or four like in the past.  This means that, “in the event of a multiple ingestion event, aircraft with two engines may have vulnerabilities not shared by their three or four engine-equipped counterparts,” claims a recent FAA report. Furthermore,“research has indicated that birds are less able to detect and avoid modern jet aircraft with quieter turbofan engines than older aircraft with noisier engines.”
						</p>
						<p>
							In New York City’s metropolitan area, bird strikes occur nearly once a day (0.9 times) on average. Across the nation’s 19,000 airports, avian strikes happen nearly 30 times a day on average. With New York’s three primary airports located near large wildlife reserves and wetlands, planes are at a high risk of migratory birds, such as those that struck US Airways Flight 1549.
						</p>
						<div class="chart-title">
							Yearly Birdstrikes at Port Authority Airports, 1990-2013
						</div>
						<div id="ChartDiv1" class="viz"></div>
						<p>
							Birdstrikes have increased at all Port Authority airports, but John F. Kennedy's wide lead is striking. One factor that contributes to JFK's high rate is its higher volume of air traffic, but flights at JFK are perhaps further prone to birdstrikes because the airport's runways are directly in front of the <a href="http://www.nyharborparks.org/visit/jaba.html">Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge</a>, an internationally-recognized Important Bird Area. Water fowl like gulls and geese nest in the marshlands that surround the airport, and predatory species like kestrels hunt prey over JFK's open fields.
						</p>
						</p>
						<p>
							JFK's placement next to such a vibrant avian habitat “is obviously a fundamental conflict,” Tod Winston, communications manager for the New York City Audubon Society, said in an email.
						</p>
						<p>
							Although the number of bird strikes is small compared with the daily number of flights in the New York City region, the hidden costs of strikes are underestimated. According to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), wildlife strikes delay planes for about 600,000 hours annually. Additionally, the cost of delays and plane damage amounts to nearly $1 billion per year, though less than 10 percent of planes sustain damage.

							As air traffic has risen across the United States, so, too, have the frequency of bird strikes. But reported bird strike rates vary dramatically from airport to airport. At some airports, bird strikes are as common as a street pigeon. Elsewhere, they’re as rare as rare as a scaly-sided merganser.
						</p>
						<p>
							A combination of factors determines the frequency with which planes hit birds. Because the Federal Aviation Administration does not require airports to report bird strikes, some tend to be more or less conscientious about reporting than others.
						</p>
						<p>
							“The frequency of bird strikes may be higher at some specific airports such as JFK because these airports emphasize on strike reporting,” said Cody Baciuska, the vice president and co-founder at <a href="http://www.loomacres.com/">Loomacres Wildlife Management</a>. “The wildlife hazard mitigation program at these airports are taking active roles. The total number of bird strikes is increasing, but the damaging rate is decreasing.”
						</p>
						<p>
							In other cases, airports are located in the path of avian migratory routes or next to popular nesting grounds, increasing the odds of a bird strike.
						</p>
						<p>
							The below map shows 85 of the country’s most trafficked passenger airports (military airports and flight schools tend to have much lower bird strike rates), color-coded according to their “bird strike rate,” defined as the number of bird strikes per 100,000 air movements (takeoffs and landings). The data is from the FAA for the year 2012.

							<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacramento_International_Airport">Sacramento International Airport</a> in California had the highest bird strike rate in 2012. With a total of 153 reported bird strikes and 115,829 movements, the airport recorded a chart-topping 132.1 strikes for every 100,000 flights. Airport officials stress that they report bird strikes far more diligently than the average airport, which partially accounts for the higher frequency.
						</p>
						<p>
							Furthermore, three full-time wildlife biologists work to make the airport’s land less attractive to birds by cutting grass, removing standing water and scaring birds away. “We’re doing everything we can to minimize the attractiveness in the most important phases of flights, which are landing and takeoffs,” said Glen Rickleton, an environment planning manager at the Sacramento County department of airports.
						</p>
						<p>
							But as with so many things, when it comes to bird strikes, what matters above all is location, location, location. Sacramento International is nestled in the northern pocket of California’s central valley, one of the country’s <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/14/magazine/californias-central-valley-land-of-a-billion-vegetables.html?hp">most productive agricultural regions</a>. The Sacramento area is home to thousands of acres of rice fields that, when flooded, provide an ideal habitat for the dozens of species of waterfowl that migrate through the region.
						</p>
						<p>
							“That’s not typical for a lot of airports. We get a lot of migratory waterfowl coming through, and not just flying through, but also landing and using the land around the airport,” said Julie Car, an environmental planner and wildlife biologist for the Sacramento Country department of airports. “We know this, and this is something we’re working on during the winter. It’s one of the times of year we know they’re coming through.”
						</p>
						<p>
							Rickleton has spoken with the California Rice Commission about ways to make surrounding farms less attractive to birds, including irrigating rice fields bit by bit rather than flooding the whole field at once. But it’s been an uphill battle.
						</p>
						<p>
							“We don’t have the authority to tell a farmer that’s been doing this for however many decades, to tell them to do it differently. It’s a sensitive issue when you start talking about that sort of thing, but we do our best” he said. Ultimately, he added, “we don’t get into telling farmers how to farm.”
						</p>
						<p>
							Though bird strikes have <a href="http://sacramento.cbslocal.com/2013/01/25/bird-strike-forces-emergency-landing-at-sacramento-international-airport/">caused emergency landings at the airport</a>, Sacramento International has been spared the severely damaging accidents like the 2009 strike that forced a U.S. Airways plane to make <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/year-anniversary-hudson-river-plane-crash-gallery-1.1579817">an emergency landing on the Hudson River</a>. “We have never had anything catastrophic like that or anything close to that,” Rickleton said. “That’s a really important distinction to make.”
						</p>
						<p>
							Indeed, Richard Dolbeer, a science advisor at U.S. Department of Agriculture, said bird strike rates in general are less of a concern as the number of strikes that result in damage. “Bird strikes per se are not a risk, but bird strikes with large or flocking species that cause damage or a negative effect on flight are a risk,” he said.
